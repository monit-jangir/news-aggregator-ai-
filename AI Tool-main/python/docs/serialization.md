## Overview

Serialization is a process of converting complex data structures or objects (e.g., agents, memories, or tools) into a format that can be easily stored, transmitted, and reconstructed later. Think of it as creating a blueprint of your object that can be used to rebuild it exactly as it was.

BeeAI framework provides robust serialization capabilities through its built-in `Serializer` class that enables:

- ðŸ’¾ Persistence: Store agent state, memory, tools, and other components
- ðŸ”„ Transmission: Send complex objects across network boundaries or processes
- ðŸ“¦ Snapshots: Create point-in-time captures of component state
- ðŸ”§ Reconstruction: Rebuild objects from their serialized representation

## Core Concepts

### `Serializable` Class

Most framework components implement the `Serializable` class with these key methods:

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `createSnapshot()` | Captures the current state |
| `loadSnapshot(snapshot)` | Applies a snapshot to the current instance |
| `fromSnapshot(snapshot)` | Creates a new instance from a snapshot (static) |
| `fromSerialized(data)` | Creates a new instance from serialized data (static) |

### Serialization Process

The serialization process involves:

1. Converting complex objects into a format that preserves their structure and data
2. Including type information to enable proper reconstruction
3. Managing references to maintain object identity across serialization boundaries
4. Handling special cases like circular references and custom types

---

## Basic Usage

### Serializing framework components

Most BeeAI components can be serialized out of the box. Here's an example using memory:

> [TIP!]
> Most framework components are `Serializable`.

## Advanced Features

### Custom Serialization

If you want to serialize a class that the `Serializer` does not know, you may register it using one of the following options.

**1. Register External Classes**

You can register external classes with the serializer:

**2. Implement the `Serializable` Interface**

For deeper integration, extend the Serializable class:

<!-- _Source: [examples/serialization/customInternal.py](/python/examples/serialization/customInternal.py)_ -->

> [NOTE!]
> Failure to register a class that the `Serializer` does not know will result in the `SerializerError` error. BeeAI framework avoids importing all potential classes automatically to prevent increased application size and unnecessary dependencies.
